# Salesforce Developer Training

This training aims to coach general software engineering skills for Salesforce
developers so they can deal with large solutions in the long run.

To book the training, contact me at tdxiaoxi2@gmail.com.

## The Issue it solves

Salesforce platform is a sizable business investment. However, many solutions
deteriorate after the first several years. 

New features take too long to publish, bugs appear here and there. This issue is
actively discussed on this [5min LinkedIn
video](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/xixiaofinland_salesforce-salesforcedeveloper-softwareengineer-activity-7086412746170261504-_KLr).

It won't fix the problem by throwing more developers or testers. On the
contrary, a small dev team with the right software engineering skills can manage
large solutions.
