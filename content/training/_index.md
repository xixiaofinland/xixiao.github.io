Salesforce platform is a sizable business investment.
Many solutions deteriorate after the first several years. See people's comments below [my 5min LinkedIn video](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/xixiaofinland_salesforce-salesforcedeveloper-softwareengineer-activity-7086412746170261504-_KLr).

New features take longer and longer to publish, bugs appear here and there. 
It won't fix the problem by throwing more developers or testers. 
On the contrary, a small dev team with right software engineering skills can
manage large solutions.

This training aims to coach essential software engineering skills for
your Salesforce development team.

The training is one or two day, and include subjects as:

- Clean code concept

This training requires active participation in discussions and frequent small
hands-on programming exercises.
